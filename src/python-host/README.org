* Python Runtime binary for Rust projects using MicroPython

  This crate uses the MicroPython bindings to the C API to provide a Python runtime
  binary that is run in a hyperlight sandbox to provide safe execution of Python code.

  To better interface with the MicroPython unsafe bindings from the `micropython-lib` crate,
  this crate exposes the `MicroPython` struct that provides safe methods to initialize the interpreter
  and execute Python code.
  Note: When the interpreter is dropped, it is deinitialized, so make sure to keep it alive
  as long as you need to run Python code.

  This crate adds the following guest functions that can be used by the host to interact with
  the MicroPython runtime:
  - `python_init`: Initialize the MicroPython interpreter with a given heap and stack.
  - `python_exec`: Execute a Python script provided as a null-terminated string.
